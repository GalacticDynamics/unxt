"""``unxt``: Quantities in JAX.

``unxt`` is a library for working with physical quantities in JAX, supporting
JAX's autodiff and JIT compilation, and easy integration with existing codes. If
you're seeing this then you're in the main module of the ``unxt`` package, where
we provide exports for the main functionality of the library. Sub-modules are
available for more specialized functionality, such as unit systems and
experimental features.

Note that `unxt` uses multiple-dispatch to provide a flexible and extensible
interface. In the docs you'll see the function signatures without type
annotation and then subsections for specific function dispatches based on the
type annotations. However dispatches registered from other modules may not be
included in the rendered docs. To see all the dispatches execute ``<func or
class>.methods`` in an interactive Python session. For more information on
multiple-dispatch see the [`plum`](https://beartype.github.io/plum/intro.html)
documentation.
