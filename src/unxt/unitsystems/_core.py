    At minimum, this consists of a set of length, time, mass, and angle units,
    but may also contain preferred representations for composite units. For
    example, the base unit system could be ``{kpc, Myr, Msun, radian}``, but you
    can also specify a preferred velocity unit, such as ``km/s``.

    This class behaves like a dictionary with keys set by physical types (i.e.
    "length", "velocity", "energy", etc.). If a unit for a particular physical
    type is not specified on creation, a composite unit will be created with the
    base units. See the examples below for some demonstrations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *units, **units
        The units that define the unit system. At minimum, this must contain
        length, time, mass, and angle units. If passing in keyword arguments,
        the keys must be valid `astropy.units` physical types.

    Examples
    --------
    If only base units are specified, any physical type specified as a key to
    this object will be composed out of the base units::

        >>> usys = UnitSystem(u.m, u.s, u.kg, u.radian)
        >>> usys["velocity"]
        Unit("m / s")

    However, preferred representations for composite units can also be
    specified::

        >>> usys = UnitSystem(u.m, u.s, u.kg, u.radian, u.erg)
        >>> usys["energy"]
        Unit("m2 kg / s2")
        >>> usys.preferred("energy")
        Unit("erg")

    This is useful for Galactic dynamics where lengths and times are usually
    given in terms of ``kpc`` and ``Myr``, but velocities are often specified in
    ``km/s``::

        >>> usys = UnitSystem(u.kpc, u.Myr, u.Msun, u.radian, u.km/u.s)
        >>> usys["velocity"]
        Unit("kpc / Myr")
        >>> usys.preferred("velocity")
        Unit("km / s")
